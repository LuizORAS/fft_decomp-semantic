/* Secondary effect function 0x03 in g_effect_secondary_handlers: the
 * particles of EFFECT_SECONDARY_ANIMATION_GOLEM.
 *
 * Initializing clears the counters. Executing starts this frame's share of the
 * Golem particle group with CLUT 13 of the weapons row and, like Finalizing,
 * steps the live slots under the secondary-effect inertia threshold and a gravity
 * of (0, ONE, 0), then puts back the effect file's own values. Once no slot is
 * live and the timer has passed the group's spawn_start_frame, finish_timer
 * counts up; the handler returns 0 on the frame after that begins, and 1 until
 * then. */
