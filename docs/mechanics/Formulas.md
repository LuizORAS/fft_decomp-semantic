# Formulas

## What it does in the game

A formula turns one action on one target into a result: whether it hits, how
much HP or MP it takes or gives, and which statuses and special effects it
adds. Every ability, weapon and consumable names a formula id, and the engine
runs that id's handler once per target and strike.

- **XA and YA.** Most formulas build two numbers. XA is the attacker's power
  (PA, MA, Speed, or a mix by weapon type) and YA the multiplier (the weapon's
  power, the ability's Y, or another stat). Damage and healing are XA * YA;
  a hit chance is XA + YA, as a percentage. X and Y come from the ability's
  data, Z from a consumable's.
- **Modifiers on XA.** Physical: Two Hands, Attack Up and Martial Arts; the
  attacker's Berserk and Frog; the target's Defense Up, Protect, Sleep,
  Charging, Chicken and Frog. Magical: Magic Attack Up, Magic Defense Up, the
  target's Shell, Frog and Chicken. Both: Strengthen for the element (XA *
  5 / 4), the zodiac compatibility (best +50%, good +25%, bad -25%, worst
  -50%) and Charge's power. A critical hit (4 in 100 while executing) grows
  XA by up to XA - 1 and may knock the target back.
- **Elements and weather.** After XA * YA, a storm cuts fire to 3/4 and
  raises lightning to 5/4, a snowstorm raises ice to 5/4; then the target's
  affinities: Absorb turns the damage into healing, Null nullifies the hit,
  Half halves and Weak doubles it. Oil should double fire damage but never
  does (`QUIRKS.md`).
- **Faith.** Magic scales by target Faith * attacker Faith / 10000; the
  Faith status counts as 100 and Innocent as 0. Some formulas skip Faith,
  and the Un-Truth formula scales by (100 - Faith) instead.
- **Evasion.** Physical attacks roll the target's accessory, shield and class
  evades in turn, each as evade / base hit (100). From the side the class
  evade is lost, from behind the shields too. Concentrate and Transparent
  remove the evades; the attacker's Darkness or Confusion, the target's
  Abandon and Defending double them; a sleeping, stopped, confused, charging
  or performing target loses them. Bows and crossbows lose a quarter of the
  base hit at night and another quarter in a storm. Magic rolls only the
  accessory and shield magic evades, whatever the direction. Only the basic
  attack and abilities flagged evadeable are evaded.
- **Hit chance.** A formula with a hit chance rolls it once: 100 or more
  always hits, 0 always misses.
- **Added effects.** A weapon's added status, a damaging spell's status and
  a spell-casting weapon's spell trigger on a 0-99 roll below 19 while
  executing; a preview always shows them, the AI never counts them. A weapon
  spell follows the hit, and is dropped when the hit kills.
- **Statuses.** A status set is added All or Nothing, as one Random status,
  each status Separately (24 in 100 each, and a quarter of the shown
  accuracy), or as removals (Cancel). Outside execution Random and Separate
  show the whole set. A set that changes nothing (immunity, a status already
  present) makes the action fail.
- **Estimates.** The menus' preview and the AI run the same handlers. Their
  random rolls take the middle value, so an estimate shows average damage and
  never a critical hit.

## Data and structures

- **The handler table.** [[g_battle_formula_handlers]] (BATTLE `0x8018f610`)
  holds the handlers for ids 0x01-0x64. [[battle_formula_id_e]] names the ids
  the engine tests itself.
- **The formula's inputs.** [[g_current_ability]]
  ([[battle_current_ability_t]]): `xa` and `ya`, the base hit and the four
  evades, both Faiths, copies of the ability's range data (X, Y, element,
  status id), of the weapon's data (power, element, formula, added status or
  spell in `proc_id`) and of the status set, Charge's power and the formula
  id. [[battle_action_run_pre_formula_setup]] fills it for each target.
- **The result.** [[battle_action_data_t]] for the target
  ([[g_battle_action_target_data]]) and for the actor
  ([[g_battle_action_attacker_data]]): hit, miss type, HP and MP damage and
  healing, stat changes ([[battle_action_stat_change_e]], CT
  [[battle_action_ct_change_e]]), special effects
  ([[battle_action_special_effect_e]]), statuses to add and remove, and the
  result type ([[battle_action_type_e]]). While the hit chance is built,
  `hp_damage` holds it.
- **When it runs.** [[g_battle_action_state]]: executing, AI simulation or
  preview.
- **Game data in MAIN.** The ability range data
  ([[g_main_ability_range_data]], 14 bytes per ability: range, area,
  vertical, four flag bytes, element, formula, X, Y, status, CT, MP); the
  weapon data ([[g_main_item_weapon_data]], 8 bytes: range, flags, formula,
  power, evade, element, added status or spell); the consumables
  ([[g_main_item_secondary_data]]: formula, Z, status). The disc holds these
  tables, not the repository.

## Main flow

1. **The formula id.** [[battle_action_run_pre_formula_setup]] picks it by
   command: the ability's, the consumable's, 0x63 for Throw, 0x64 for Jump, or
   the weapon's for Attack and Charge (Charge only adds its power). Formula 0
   or one above 0x64 becomes 0x01, and formula 0x03 loads no status. The
   reactions that come before the formula may make the strike miss first
   (Reflect, Blade Grasp, Arrow Guard).
2. **The handler.** It typically checks evasion
   ([[battle_formula_calculate_physical_evade]] or
   [[battle_formula_calculate_magical_evade]]), builds XA and YA (a
   `battle_formula_store_*` helper or [[battle_formula_calculate_base_xa]]),
   applies the modifiers, then either rolls a hit chance
   ([[battle_formula_store_hit_chance]], [[battle_formula_roll_hit_chance]])
   or stores the damage ([[battle_formula_calculate_physical_damage]],
   [[battle_formula_calculate_elemental_xa_times_ya]]), scales it by Faith
   ([[battle_formula_calculate_faith]]), applies the element
   ([[battle_formula_apply_element_affinities]],
   [[battle_formula_apply_elemental_absorption]]) and rolls the added effect
   ([[battle_formula_roll_conditional_status_proc]]) before the status
   ([[battle_formula_apply_status_to_action]]).
3. **After it.** [[battle_action_finalize_target_current_action]] checks the
   result (999 caps, invalid targets); formulas below 0x07 check Poach and
   Train ([[battle_formula_apply_poach_and_train]]), and Jump drops its
   weapon. The [[Action]] page applies the result.

## Where to change

- **A formula's steps:** its handler in the table above. Formulas share the
  helpers, so a change in a `battle_formula_apply_*` or
  `battle_formula_calculate_*` helper reaches every formula that calls it;
  the [[Changing a formula]] guide walks through it.
- **Which formula an ability, weapon or item uses, and its X, Y and Z:** the
  game data in MAIN (disc data).
- **Which formula a command forces (Throw, Jump, Charge's weapon):**
  [[battle_action_run_pre_formula_setup]].
- **Strikes per action (formulas 0x1e, 0x1f, 0x5e):**
  [[battle_action_init_current_ability_strike_data]].
- **Evasion:** [[battle_formula_calculate_physical_evade]],
  [[battle_formula_calculate_magical_evade]] and their steps; direction,
  [[battle_formula_calculate_facing_evade]].
- **Critical hits:** [[battle_formula_calculate_critical_hit]].
- **Supports and statuses on XA:**
  [[battle_formula_apply_physical_attack_supports]],
  [[battle_formula_apply_physical_status_xa_modifiers]],
  [[battle_formula_apply_magical_xa_modifiers]].
- **Elements, weather, Faith, zodiac:**
  [[battle_formula_apply_element_affinities]],
  [[battle_formula_apply_weather_elemental_effects]],
  [[battle_formula_calculate_faith]],
  [[battle_formula_apply_zodiac_compatibility]].
- **The 19% added effect:**
  [[battle_formula_roll_conditional_status_proc_inner]].
- **How a status set lands:** [[battle_formula_apply_status_to_action]].
- **Steal, Break and Might Sword targets:**
  [[battle_formula_select_target_equipment]].
- **Today's limits:** every change must keep the original bytes; code that
  grows or moves waits for the shiftable build (`CODEBASE.md`, "What can
  change today").

## Quirks and debts

- Oil never raises fire damage: [[battle_formula_apply_ability_element]]
  doubles XA after the damage is stored (`QUIRKS.md`).
- The bow weather penalty reads the raw weather variable, so a snowstorm
  counts and the map's ignore-weather flag does not
  ([[battle_formula_apply_weather_effects_on_bows]], `QUIRKS.md`).
- Holy Sword and Might Sword apply the weapon's element only; the element in
  the ability's data is never read (`QUIRKS.md`).
- [[battle_formula_calculate_critical_hit]] and
  [[battle_formula_apply_ability_element]] call argument-less helpers through
  casts that pass an ignored argument (`QUIRKS.md`).
- Formulas 0x05, 0x11, 0x13, 0x18, 0x19, 0x3e, 0x46 and 0x60 have no retail
  user, and [[battle_formula_49_unused_with_extra_steps]] is referenced
  nowhere on the disc.
