# Items and Shops

## What it does in the game

- **Items.** There are 253 items (ids 1 to 0xfd), grouped by id:

  | Ids | Kind |
  |---|---|
  | `0x01`-`0x79` | weapons |
  | `0x7a`-`0x7f` | throwing items (shuriken, balls) |
  | `0x80`-`0x8f` | shields |
  | `0x90`-`0xab` | headgear |
  | `0xac`-`0xcf` | body armor |
  | `0xd0`-`0xef` | accessories |
  | `0xf0`-`0xfd` | consumables (Potion to Phoenix Down) |

  Each has a record in [[g_main_item_primary_data]] (price, type, item level,
  shop level) and, by kind, a weapon, shield, armor, accessory or consumable
  record.
- **The inventory.** [[g_main_item_quantities]] holds a byte per item. The
  party owns at most 99 copies of an item, counting the ones its units have
  equipped ([[main_item_get_total_equipment_quantity]]). A new game starts
  with 5 Potions, 2 Hi-Potions, 2 Eye Drops, 2 Phoenix Downs and one each of
  ten other consumables ([[main_item_init_new_game_inventory]]).
- **Over 99.** A copy that would be the hundredth is turned into gil instead:
  - in battle (a steal, a catch, a treasure) and in the war trophies, for a
    quarter of its price;
  - after the battle, gear that departing units hand back, for a quarter of
    its price ([[require_party_store_equipment_or_sell_overflow]]);
  - on leaving the soldier office, whose recruits bring their own gear, for
    half its price ([[world_item_cash_out_excess_inventory]]).
- **Who can equip what.** A unit can equip an item when its job's
  equippable types include the item's type. The Equip support abilities add
  types (Equip Armor covers headgear and armor), and a female unit can also
  equip ribbons, bags and perfume ([[main_unit_set_equippable_items]],
  [[world_unit_can_equip_item_id]]).

  The hands pair as follows ([[world_formation_can_equip_item_in_slot]],
  [[equip_unit_can_equip_item_id]]):
  - two weapons need Two Swords and two Two Swords compatible weapons;
  - two shields never pair;
  - a shield never pairs with a two-handed-only weapon.

  Equipping an item that does not pair takes the other hand's item off.
- **Best fit.** Best fit picks the best-ranked item for each slot:
  - weapons by power, shields by physical evade, headgear and armor by HP
    bonus, accessories by item level;
  - with the same Two Hands, Two Swords and Martial Arts rules
    ([[world_unit_build_best_fit_equipment]] in the formation,
    [[world_shop_build_fitting_room_best_fit_equipment]] in a shop).
- **Outfitters.** Each of the fifteen towns has an outfitter (shop id = its
  location id). It sells an item when that town's bit is set in the item's
  [[g_world_shop_item_availability]] mask and the item's shop level is at
  most the story's shop progress, `EVENT_SCRIPT_VAR_SHOP_ITEM_AVAILABILITY`
  ([[world_shop_build_item_list]]). The menu is Buy / Sell / Fitting room /
  Leave store.

  | Town | Items stocked | Town | Items stocked |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Lesalia | 107 | Dorter | 130 |
  | Riovanes | 116 | Zaland | 95 |
  | Igros | 116 | Goug | 49 |
  | Lionel | 116 | Warjilis | 130 |
  | Limberry | 116 | Bervenia | 95 |
  | Zeltennia | 116 | Zarghidas | 130 |
  | Gariland | 105 | | |
  | Yardow | 95 | | |
  | Goland | 95 | | |

  The shop levels run from 1 (Dagger, Broad Sword, Rod...) to 15 (Thief
  Hat). 55 items carry level 20 and no town bit (only bit `0x0001`), so no
  outfitter sells them.
- **Buying and selling.**
  - **Buying:** the quantity stops at what the gil pays for and at 99 owned
    ([[world_shop_run_buy_quantity_menu]]).
  - **Selling:** half the price, at least 1 ([[world_item_get_half_price]]),
    and only copies in the inventory ("They're all equipped. You still gotta
    remove 'em").
  - **Who can equip it:** Triangle in the buy list shows the units that can
    equip the item, with a stat preview.
- **The fitting room.** Units try on shop items before paying:
  - **Try it on:** equips a shop item and adds its price to the fitting
    room's cost. The unit's own item is kept aside
    ([[g_world_shop_fitting_room_items]]).
  - **Best fit:** puts on the best the shop and the unit offer.
  - **Quit fitting:** takes a tried-on item off and puts the unit's own item
    back.
  - **Sell:** sells equipped items (Sell equip) or the stock.
  - **Fitting over:** asks for the total. Paying makes the tried-on items the
    units' own and puts the kept items in the inventory; leaving without
    buying puts everything back ([[world_shop_run_fitting_room_checkout_prompt]]).
- **The fur shop.**
  - **Entry:** it opens only when a roster unit has Secret Hunt.
  - **Its stock** ([[g_main_item_poached_quantities]]) is what monsters
    killed with Secret Hunt leave: the rare item with a chance of 31 in 256,
    else the common one, by monster job
    ([[battle_action_add_poached_item_to_fur_shop_inventory]]).
  - **Buying and selling** are both at half price, and sold copies join the
    stock.
- **The soldier office.** The menu is Male fighter / Female fighter / Change
  name / Leave store.
  - **A fighter:**
    - is generated into the roster with its starting gear;
    - costs 1000 gil plus that gear's prices (1500 and 1400 with the retail
      prices, the amounts the menu shows);
    - is confirmed or dismissed after a preview.
  - **Change name:** renames a monster for free; Reis in dragon form refuses.
- **War trophies.** After a battle each unit on the field gives its war
  trophy item and its bonus money × 100, and the war funds gain the enemies'
  level sum × 100 ([[battle_unit_find_war_trophies_and_bonus_money]],
  [[require_reward_collect_war_trophies_and_bonus_money]]). The war funds
  stop at 99,999,999 everywhere.

## Data and structures

| Record | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [[item_data_t]] | An item (12 bytes, [[g_main_item_primary_data]] at MAIN `0x80062eb8`): palette, sprite, item level, type flags, secondary record, type, attributes, price, shop level |
| [[weapon_data_t]], [[shield_data_t]], [[armor_data_t]], [[accessory_data_t]], [[item_secondary_data_t]] | The kind records ([[g_main_item_weapon_data]] `0x80063ab8`, [[g_main_item_shield_data]] `0x80063eb8`, [[g_main_item_helm_armor_secondary_data]] `0x80063ed8`, [[g_main_item_accessory_data]] `0x80063f58`, [[g_main_item_secondary_data]] `0x80063f98`) |
| [[g_main_item_quantities]] | The inventory, a byte per item (MAIN `0x800596e0`) |
| [[g_main_item_poached_quantities]] | The fur shop's stock, a byte per item (MAIN `0x80059494`) |
| [[g_main_item_poach_table]] | Common and rare item per monster job (MAIN `0x80066064`, 48 rows) |
| [[g_world_shop_item_availability]] | Each item's town mask, most significant byte first: bit `0x8000 >> town` (WORLD `0x8018d844`) |
| [[g_world_shop_menu_step_handlers]] | The shop screen's 28 steps ([[world_shop_step_e]], WORLD `0x8019523c`) |
| [[g_world_shop_fitting_room_items]] | Per unit and slot, the own item kept aside while it tries on a shop item |
| [[battle_war_result_t]] | A battle's war trophies and money |

## Main flow

1. **Entering a shop.** WLDCORE's town menu calls [[world_shop_run_screen]]
   with the outfitter, the fur shop or the soldier office. It runs one step
   handler a frame until the step is `WORLD_SHOP_STEP_EXIT`, then saves the
   formation records to the roster.
2. **Outfitter.** [[world_shop_run_main_menu_step]] leads to:
   - the buy list ([[world_shop_run_buy_list_step]],
     [[world_shop_run_buy_confirm_step]]);
   - the sell list ([[world_shop_run_sell_list_step]],
     [[world_shop_run_sell_confirm_step]]);
   - the fitting room ([[world_shop_run_fitting_room_step]] and its steps,
     ending in [[world_shop_run_fitting_room_checkout_step]]).
3. **Fur shop and soldier office.** They start at [[world_shop_run_fur_menu_step]]
   and [[world_shop_run_soldier_office_menu_step]].
4. **Elsewhere.**
   - the formation's item screen ([[world_item_run_category_menu]]) and
     equipment menus;
   - BATTLE's EQUIP screen (`equip_*`, the same rules as WORLD's
     `world_item_*`);
   - item gains in battle (Action page);
   - the war trophies and departing units' gear after a battle (REQUIRE).

## Where to change

- **An item's stats, price or kind:** the item records (disc data).
- **What a town sells and when:** [[g_world_shop_item_availability]] and the
  item's shop level; the progress variable is set by event scripts.
- **Sale and overflow rates:**
  - half price: [[world_item_get_half_price]];
  - a quarter in battle and after it: [[battle_action_add_war_funds]],
    [[require_party_store_equipment_or_sell_overflow]],
    [[require_reward_collect_war_trophies_and_bonus_money]].
- **Who can equip what:** the job's equippable types (job data),
  [[main_unit_set_equippable_items]] for the Equip supports, and the hand
  rules in [[world_formation_can_equip_item_in_slot]] and
  [[equip_unit_can_equip_item_id]].
- **The fur shop:** its gate in [[world_shop_run_fur_menu_step]], its stock
  in [[battle_action_add_poached_item_to_fur_shop_inventory]] and the poach
  table.
- **Recruits:** the starting gear in [[g_main_unit_generation_base_data]];
  the fee in [[world_shop_run_soldier_office_menu_step]] and the amounts the
  menu shows in [[world_shop_get_soldier_office_entry_fee]].

[[Changing items and shops]] walks through these changes.

## Quirks and debts

- The evade sorts of [[world_item_sort_id_list]] and
  [[equip_item_sort_list_by_criteria]] index the shield and accessory tables
  with throwing items and armor.
- [[world_item_cash_out_excess_inventory]] never reaches Phoenix Down.
- Fur shop quirks:
  - its "sell" list is the ordinary inventory at half price;
  - selling adds the copies to the poached stock;
  - buying divides the gil by half the price with no lower bound
    ([[world_shop_run_fur_buy_quantity_menu]]).
- [[world_item_build_category_list]] and [[world_shop_build_item_list]] treat
  the two hand filters the same.
- WLDCORE opens every outfitter with shop id 0; [[world_shop_run_screen]]
  takes the town from the location variable.
- [[battle_unit_find_war_trophies_and_bonus_money]] computes a level bonus
  that nothing pays.
- EQUIP never fills the accessory's physical evade slot of its unit
  preview.
