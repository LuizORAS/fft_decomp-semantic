# Battle flow

## What it does in the game

How a battle runs from its setup to its close. Units take turns in CT order:
every clock tick adds a unit's Speed to its CT, and the first past 99 gets a
turn. On its turn a unit may move once and act once, in either order, then
chooses a facing; a unit the player does not control decides through the AI.
Abilities with a charge time resolve later, when their own counter runs out.
Reactions answer an action, and a First Strike can cancel it. Between turns,
timed statuses run out and event scripts can play. An event script also ends
the battle: on to the world map, the next battle, a reset or the ending.

## Data and structures

- **The state machine.** [[g_battle_game_state]] holds a
  [[battle_game_state_e]] value, and [[battle_state_run_game_loop]] runs its
  handler once a frame (the table below). Effects and map changes save it in
  [[g_previous_battle_game_state]] and return to it.
- **Frame rate.** [[g_battle_state_vsync_interval]] is 1 (60 fps) or 2
  (30 fps), and animation counters advance by it, so they keep real time at
  both rates. A slow effect frame starts a slowdown
  ([[g_battle_state_slowdown_frames]]); effect scripts can ask for a minimum
  ([[g_battle_state_min_vsync_interval]]).
- **Turn order.** Each unit's [[battle_stats_t]] holds `ct`, `has_turn`,
  `movement_taken`, `action_taken` and `charged_ability_ct` (0xff when nothing
  is charging). The clock's phase is [[g_battle_turn_clock_state]],
  [[g_battle_turn_event]] holds the type of the last event it gave
  ([[battle_turn_event_e]]) and [[g_battle_turn_unit_id]] the unit whose turn
  it is. [[battle_turn_get_status_flags]] sums up what a unit's statuses do to
  its turns ([[battle_turn_status_flags_e]]).
- **The AT list.** 40 [[battle_at_entry_t]] entries that
  [[battle_turn_build_at_list]] rebuilds whenever it is shown, by simulating
  the clock; nothing keeps the list between uses.
- **Window answers.** States that open a window read
  [[g_battle_menu_selected_command]]: 7 goes on, 8 or 0xff (cancel) goes
  back. [[g_battle_action_post_action]] marks that the window or the step has
  finished.
- **The action.** The acting unit's command sits in its
  [[battle_unit_misc_data_t]] (`command_state`), and [[g_battle_action_phase]]
  steps through a First Strike (0), the action itself (1) and the reactions
  (2).

## Main flow

1. **Setup.** [[battle_state_run_battle_setup]] loads the map, units, event,
   music and the deployment screen, the turn clock is reset
   (`battle_turn_run_clock(1)`), and [[battle_state_run_game_loop]] runs one
   state handler a frame.
2. **The turn clock.** [[battle_turn_advance]] takes the next event through
   [[battle_turn_take_next_event]], which runs [[battle_turn_run_clock]]
   until a phase yields one:

| Clock phase | What happens | Event |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Every unit gains its Speed in CT: half under Slow, 1.5 times under Haste, at most 254 | |
| 1 | The unit with the highest CT above 99 gets its turn, after its status upkeep (Reraise, the death counter, Death Sentence, the end of Defend, low Brave); a jumping unit waits at CT 99 | `UNIT_READY`, or `ACTION_RESULT` |
| 2–3 | Charged abilities count down; one that reaches 0 resolves | `ABILITY_READY` |
| 9 | After it, a unit at CT 255 (Quick) gets its turn at once | `UNIT_READY` |
| 4–6 | Timed statuses run out, and each unit's result comes out | `ACTION_RESULT` |
| 10, 19, 15, 17 | Turns that are over end; the turn unit's poison and regen, terrain poison and the end of Transparent come out | `ACTION_RESULT` |
| 13–14 | After an ability, each Mime copies it | `ABILITY_READY`, or `MIME` |

3. **A turn event begins.** Unless an ending or scenario event starts first,
   [[battle_turn_advance]] enters CHANGE_TURN. A unit's turn opens its menus
   (OPEN_ACTION_MENUS, then IDLING_ACTION_MENUS), or AI_COMMAND for a unit
   the player does not control; a due ability goes to ACTION_CAST; a status
   result or a failed Mime copy shows its message in STATUS_EXECUTE.
4. **Move.** UNIT_MOVE (the Move window), SELECT_MOVE_TILE, UNIT_MOVING_SETUP
   ("move here?"), UNIT_MOVING (the walk) and MOVE_CONFIRM_MENU, where "no"
   undoes the move unless it was a teleport. CRYSTAL_LEARN then handles what
   the move left pending, such as a crystal on the tile.
5. **Act.** TARGETING_MESSAGE, TARGETING_RANGE (a tile out of range goes to
   ILLEGAL_RANGE), ABILITY_PREVIEW_HANDLING, CONFIRM_ACTION and
   PRE_ATTACK_ANIMATION, where [[battle_action_execute_ability]] starts
   charging an ability that has a charge time, acts at once, or jumps.
6. **The action.** COMMENCE_ATTACK_PHASE runs the phases through
   [[battle_state_announce_next_ability]]. Each part is announced
   (ANNOUNCE_ABILITY), its extra attack frames and effect file load
   (OPEN_SP2_FILES, START_EFFECT_FILE_OPEN), the effect plays
   (START_ACTION_EXECUTE, ACTION_EXECUTE) and its message shows
   (BATTLE_MESSAGE_DISPLAY). RESUME_ATTACK_PHASE shows the effect messages,
   strikes again for a continued attack or goes on to the next phase. Then
   the action's EXP and JP are granted, and LEARN_ABILITY_ON_HIT reports level
   ups and abilities learned on hit.
7. **After the command.** AFTER_COMMAND waits for the numbers to go;
   CONTINUE_TURN reopens the menus while the turn goes on, goes to Wait
   (WAIT_MENU, WAIT_DIRECTION) when it is over, or, after a due ability, takes
   the next turn event. When the turn ends, [[battle_turn_end]] sets the
   unit's CT: what was left, plus 20 if it did not move and 20 if it did not
   act, at most 60.
8. **Events and the end.** An event script runs in EVENT, and the
   MAP_JUMPING states change the map behind a fade. When a scenario finishes,
   CLOSE_BATTLE fades out and the game flow says what follows: the world map
   (event result 9), the next battle (0xA), a reset (0xB) or the ending
   (0x13).

## Where to change

- **CT gain, Haste and Slow:** [[battle_turn_run_clock]] (phase 0). The AT
  list simulates the same rules in [[battle_turn_build_at_list]], and the AI
  runs the clock itself, so a change belongs in both functions.
- **CT after a turn (the 20/20/60 rule):** [[battle_turn_end]].
- **What ends a turn:** [[battle_turn_should_end]] and [[battle_turn_is_over]];
  which statuses stop turns or CT: [[battle_turn_get_status_flags]].
- **Undoing a move:** [[battle_state_handle_move_confirm_menu_state]].
- **The order of First Strike, the action and reactions:**
  [[battle_state_announce_next_ability]] and
  [[battle_state_handle_resume_attack_phase_state]].
- **How long AI units pause (31 frames):** the AI branches of
  [[battle_state_handle_ai_command_state]],
  [[battle_state_handle_select_move_tile_state]],
  [[battle_state_handle_targeting_range_state]],
  [[battle_state_handle_ability_preview_state]] and
  [[battle_state_handle_wait_direction_state]].
- **Frame rate and slowdown:** [[battle_state_set_vsync_interval]] and
  [[battle_state_sync_frame]].
- **What follows a battle:** the event results in
  [[battle_state_handle_event_state]].
- **Today's limits:** every change must keep the original bytes; code that
  grows or moves waits for the shiftable build (`CODEBASE.md`, "What can
  change today").

## Quirks and debts

- [[battle_state_handle_change_map_jumping_in_state]] maps event results 9
  and 0xA to the opposite game flows from [[battle_state_handle_event_state]]
  and ignores 0xB and 0x13.
- [[battle_turn_take_next_event]] handles turn event 0x400, which the clock
  never produces.
- [[battle_state_run_game_loop]] leaves its frame loop in the frame that
  enters CLOSE_BATTLE, so [[battle_state_handle_close_battle_state]] never
  runs there.
- [[battle_turn_run_clock]]'s mode 2 has no caller.
